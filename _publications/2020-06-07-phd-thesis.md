The thesis studies the how to efficiently and effectively learn Markov blankets from data. The thesis also studies some of the properties of Markov blankets, so that their quality can be further improved by using these properties. The main application of Markov blankets that this thesis concerns is scaling up Bayesian network structure learning to high dimensional data sets.
