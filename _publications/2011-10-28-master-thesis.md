The channel assignment problem is concerned with assigning a channel to each of a set of transmitters such that the maximum span of the channels is minimized under some distance constraints. Given p1, p2, p3,... all positive integers, an L(p1, p2, p3,...)-labelling of a graph is an assignment of nonnegative integers to its vertices such that vertices at distance i apart must receive labels with separation at least pi. The span of such a labelling is the difference between the maximum and minimum labels used. The objective is to find the minimum span over all L(p1, p2, p3,...)-labellings of the graph. In this paper, we focus on L (h, p, q)-labellings of complete m-ary trees. We prove that the minimum span of the L(h, p, q)-labelling of complete mary trees is an exact value. In the second part of this thesis, we introduce another labelling system the C(p1, p2, p3,...)-labelling, called the cyclic metric labelling. We prove that the minimum span of the C(h, 1, 1)-labelling of complete m-ary trees is also an exact value, but this time it is dependent upon the parameter m and h.
