Moral graphs were introduced in the 1980s
as an intermediate step when transforming
a Bayesian network to a junction tree, on
which exact belief propagation can be efficiently done. The moral graph of a Bayesian
network can be trivially obtained by connecting non-adjacent parents for each node in the
Bayesian network and dropping the direction
of each edge. Perhaps because the moralization process looks simple, there has been little
attention on the properties of moral graphs and
their impact in belief propagation on Bayesian
networks. This paper addresses the mistaken
claim that it has been previously proved that
optimal moral graph triangulation with the
constraints of minimum fill-in, treewidth or total states is NP-complete. The problems are in
fact NP-complete, but they have not previously
been proved. We now prove these.
