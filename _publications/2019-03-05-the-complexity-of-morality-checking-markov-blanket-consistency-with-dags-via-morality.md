A family of Markov blankets in a faithful
Bayesian network satisfies the symmetry and
consistency properties. In this paper, we draw a
bijection between families of consistent Markov
blankets and moral graphs. We define the new
concepts of weak recursive simpliciality and perfect elimination kits. We prove that they are
equivalent to graph morality. In addition, we
prove that morality can be decided in polynomial
time for graphs with maximum degree less than 5,
but the problem is NP-complete for graphs with
higher maximum degrees.
