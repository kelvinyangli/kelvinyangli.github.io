I joined the Research School of Computer Science, Australian National University in August 2019 as a research fellow, under the supervision of Kee Siong Ng. My research interests are graph theory and computational complexity theory. My primary focus at the moment is on graph-based entity resolution between large databases. Besides this, I also work on adaptive data analysis with the notion of differential privacy to ensure algorithmic stability. 

Before joining ANU, I completed a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Melbourne, majored in philosophy and mathematics. I then completed a Master of Science degree at the same university, majored in mathematics and researched in graph theory under the supervision of Sanming Zhou and Deborah King. After a couple of years of tough time, I was lucky enough to be admitted as a PhD student by my supervisors Kevin Korb and Lloyd Allison at the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University. My original research project was to scale up Bayesian network structure learning using the local-to-global paradigm via Markov blankets. Due to my enthusiastic in graph theory and computational complexity theory, only parts of the original project were completed together with solutions to some interesting and challenging problems that I discovered on my own along the way.
