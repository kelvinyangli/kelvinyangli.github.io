I am a research fellow at the Research School of Computer Science, the Australian National University. I work in the graph analytics group under the supervision of Kee Siong Ng. My research interests are a mixture of mathematics, computer science and machine learning. I have worked on problems in graph theory, computational complexity theory, causal discovery, differential privacy and homomorphic encryption. 

Before joining ANU, I completed a Bachelor of Arts degree (majored in philosophy and mathematics) and a Master of Science degree (majored in mathematics) at the University of Melbourne. My research topic during the master study was in graph labelling under the supervision of Sanming Zhou and Deborah King. My PhD project was supervised by Kevin Korb and Lloyd Allison at the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University. The work was about scaling up Bayesian network structure learning using the local-to-global paradigm via Markov blankets.
