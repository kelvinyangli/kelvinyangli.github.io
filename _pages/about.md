I am a research fellow at the School of Computing, the Australian National University, Canberra. I work under the supervision of Associate Professor Kee Siong Ng. I am also part of the Software Innovation Institute (https://sii.anu.edu.au/). My research areas including graph theory, theoretical computer science, machine learning, differential privacy and homomorphic encryption. 

Before joining ANU, I completed a Doctor of Philosophy degree at Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University (Clayton), under the supervision of Dr. Kevin Korb and Dr. Lloyd Allison. I also have a Bachelor of Arts degree (majored in philosophy and mathematics) and a Master of Science degree (majored in mathematics) at the University of Melbourne. My master research project in graph theory was supervised by Professor Sanming Zhou and Professor Deborah King.
