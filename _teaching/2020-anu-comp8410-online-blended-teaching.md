(Quote from ANU Handbook) Massive amounts of data are being collected by public and private organisations, and research projects, while the Internet provides a very large source of information about almost every aspect of human life and society. Analysing such data can provide significant benefits to an organisation. This course provides a practical focus on the technology and research in the area of data mining. It focuses on the algorithms and techniques and less on the mathematical and statistical foundations.
